# Start using the SDK

Now that you got the SDK added as project dependency and generated your types from the schema using the CLI’s codegen (if you didn’t, please check [Installation](/getting-started/installation)). It’s time to create our first queries!

## Importing the Client

The `.ts` file generated from the codegen exports a `getXataClient` method. This is a sync method that will return the instance of your SDK, already configured with: your schema types, `XATA_API_KEY`, `XATA_BRANCH`, and `XATA_DATABASE_URL` - everything coming from your project configuration.

```ts
// file generated by xata init
import { getXataClient } from './src/xata'

const xata = getXataClient()

// if `posts` is a table in your DB
const { records } = await xata.db.posts.getPaginated()

console.log(records)
```

The above snippet queries `posts` table for the first 20 records, and returns an object with them in `records` array as well as a cursor in a `meta` object.

## Regenerating Schema Types

If your schema changes, you can regenerate your schema types for your Xata database via the CLI:

- Globally installed:

```sh
xata codegen
```

- Straight from the package registry:

```sh
npx @xata.io/cli@latest codegen
```
