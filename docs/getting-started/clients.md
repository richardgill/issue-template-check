# Client SDKs

Xata offers a set of client SDKs to help you build your application. The SDKs are available for the following languages:

<div className="docs-cards">
    <div className="docs-card-group">
        <a href="/typescript-client/overview" className="docs-card">
            <span>JavaScript and TypeScript</span>
            <p>Type-safe SDK for Node.js, V8 and Deno</p>
        </a>
        <a href="/python-sdk/overview" className="docs-card">
            <span>Python</span>
            <p>Work in progress SDK client for Python 3.8+</p>
        </a>
    </div>
</div>

## UI Playground

The Xata Web UI contains a playground where you can try out the SDK.

Right now the playground is only available for the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK, but we plan to add support for other languages in the future.

To access the SDK playground, click the **SDK Playground** button in the sidebar. This will present you with a type-safe interface with a `xata` object that exposes the various SDK methods. To get more familiar with these methods, see [the SDK's usage page](/typescript-client/overview#usage).

### Using Playground Queries

Once you've written a query you're happy with and would like to use it in your application, this is usually accomplished via copy/pasteâ€“provided your application is already set up to use the Xata SDK.

After pasting code from the playground, you'll only have to adjust your import of `xata` to point to the file generated by the Xata CLI (Command Line Interface). For more on code generation, see the [Code Generation](/cli/installation) section of the CLI docs.
