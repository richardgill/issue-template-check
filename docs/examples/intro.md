# Xata Examples

Xata is a versatile serverless data platform that can be used with multiple application architectures. The examples contained in this section demonstrate _how to implement_ certain functionality with Xata, from user authentication to image and file uploads and storage. They are intended to serve as a guide for how to solve a specific problem when working with Xata.

We also highlight existing production open-source applications that use Xata in this section as examples that you can learn from when learning how to build your own applications with Xata.
