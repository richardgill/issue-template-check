### VS Code Extension

Our VS Code Extension aims for feature parity with the [Xata Web UI](https://app.xata.io). It leverages the Xata CLI to provide a all-in-one dashboard / integration mechanism for your projects with VS Code.

- If you already have an `.env` file it will show your Databases in the **Explorer** section.
- If you already have a `.env` file and a `.xatarc` file it will also show your project’s database in the **Project** section
- If any of those are missing, you’ll see "Get Started" buttons that will trigger some prompts to get you set.

The full [documentation](https://github.com/xataio/vs-code-extension) is on GitHub.
