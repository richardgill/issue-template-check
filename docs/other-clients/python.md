# Python SDK

The Python SDK is available as a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/xata/).

We recommend using Python 3.5 or higher.

This client SDK is in active development and is not yet ready for production use.

You can read more about the Python SDK in its [API reference](https://xata-py.readthedocs.io).
