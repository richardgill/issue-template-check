# Xata SDK for TypeScript and JavaScript

The Xata SDK supports typescript definitions for your Xata database schema. It also works with JavaScript.

It has zero dependencies and can run in Node.js, V8, Deno, and Bun.

## Usage

There are three ways to use the SDK:

- Schema-generated Client: SDK to create/read/update/delete records in a given database following a schema file (with type-safety).
- Schema-less Client: SDK to create/read/update/delete records in any database without schema validation (with partial type-safety).
- API Client: SDK to interact with the whole Xata API and all its endpoints.
