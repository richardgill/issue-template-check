# Overview

Xata is a **Serverless Data Platform**.

You can think of it as the combination of a <em>serverless relational database</em>, a <em>search engine</em>, and an <em>analytics</em> engine, everything existing behind a single consistent <em>REST API</em>.

Xata has first-class support for branches, a workflow for zero-downtime schema migrations, as well as support for edge caching.

If you’re in an exploring mood, we recommend to read more about:
