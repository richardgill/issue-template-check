# Namespace Reference

The API surface of the Python SDK is organized into namespaces, with each namespace associated with a specific set of APIs. For instance, the `databases` namespace provides access to all the available Xata endpoints for managing databases. 

The endpoints and namespaces are generated from the [OpenAPI specification](/rest-api/openapi).

> â“˜ Alternatively, you can directly instantiate a namespace, as demonstrated in this [example](python-sdk/examples#get-a-record-from-a-table).
